# Capacity Tool

Hello!

I hope this stuff is useful for you. As all the OSS, there's no warranty that it works perfect,
but it gets the job done. So, I think is good enough. :D

## Prerrequisites
- Read the guide that I will put in our shared OneNote. I won't include the link
    since it's changing continuously.
- CSV file should be named 'outlook_calendar.csv' in order to work. If you think
  that's an ugly or boring name feel free to change it in the file, but don't 
  forget to change it also in the python script (line 31). ;)

## Usage
1. You need to export your outlook calendar following the steps included in the
   guide I mentioned above.
2. Run the script in the directory where you have the CSV and the python script.
3. Voil√°, the script will print all the hours for every category between the dates
   that you put in  the prompt.

## Warnings
- The script will ignore all the meetings that have no category or are labeled as
	  'NA'. Check the guide for more information.
